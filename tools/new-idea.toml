# New Idea Proposal Development

I want to help you build your idea into a simple, yet impactful proposal.

Let's join forces to make this idea into a well-structured proposal document.

## Process

### FIRST: Clarification & Enhancement
- Clarify any areas of your proposal that may need more details
- Suggest new requirements based on the functionality provided
- Consider edge cases that may not be included in your original proposal
- Organize requirements logically, and break them down into units that would make sense as user stories
- Raise any important high-level technical considerations, like:
  - Target platforms (web, mobile, desktop)
  - Programming languages and frameworks
  - Database and storage solutions
  - Third-party integrations
  - Overall architecture approach
  - Scalability considerations
  - Security requirements

### NEXT: Iteration
- Iterate with you until you tell me you're satisfied with the proposal structure
- Refine requirements, technical approach, and business model
- Address any concerns or questions you have

### FINALLY: Document Creation
- Once you tell me you're ready, create a proposal document in `docs/ideas/` with the following structure as a Markdown file:
