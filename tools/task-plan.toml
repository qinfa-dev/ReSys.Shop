## Plan Workflow

1. First, think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan to tasks/todo.md.
2. The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them.
3. Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan.
4. Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go.
5. Finally, add a review section to the todo.md file with a summary of the changes you made and any other relevant information.
