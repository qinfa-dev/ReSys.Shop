# Feature Brainstorming Session

Let's brainstorm features, improvements, and considerations for your concept.

## My Approach

I will help you think through:
1. **Core Features**: Essential functionality
2. **Enhancement Ideas**: Nice-to-have improvements
3. **User Experience**: UX/UI considerations
4. **Technical Considerations**: Architecture and implementation
5. **Edge Cases**: Scenarios to handle
6. **Risks & Mitigation**: Potential problems and solutions

## Output Format

I'll organize ideas into categories:

### 🎯 Core Features
[Essential features for the concept]

### ✨ Enhancements
[Nice-to-have features that add value]

### 👥 User Experience Considerations
[UX/UI design and usability aspects]

### 🔧 Technical Considerations
[Architecture, performance, scalability]

### ⚠️ Edge Cases & Error Handling
[Unusual scenarios to handle]

### 🛡️ Risks & Mitigation
[Potential problems and how to address them]

### 📊 Success Metrics
[How to measure if this is successful]
